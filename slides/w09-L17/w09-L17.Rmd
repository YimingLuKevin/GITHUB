    y = NULL,
    title = 'Spam vs. "re:" in subject'
    ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#DEB4A0", "#CA235F"))
```

---

## Modelling spam

- Both number of characters and whether the message has "re:" in the subject might be related to whether the email is spam.  How do we come up with a model that will let us explore this relationship?

--
- For simplicity, we'll focus on the number of characters (`num_char`) as predictor, but the model we describe can be expanded to take multiple predictors as well.

---

## Modelling spam

This isn't something we can reasonably fit a linear model to -- we need something different!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
means <- email %>%
  group_by(spam) %>%
  summarise(mean_num_char = mean(num_char)) %>%
  mutate(group = 1)

ggplot(email, aes(x = num_char, y = spam, color = spam)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_line(data = means, aes(x = mean_num_char, y = spam, group = group), color = "black", linewidth = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Number of characters (in thousands)", y = "Spam") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#DEB4A0", "#CA235F")) +
  guides(color = "none")
```

---

## Framing the problem

- We can treat each outcome (spam and not) as successes and failures arising from separate Bernoulli trials
  - Bernoulli trial: a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes, "success" and "failure", in which the probability of success is the same every time the experiment is conducted

--
- Each Bernoulli trial can have a separate probability of success

$$ y_i ∼ Bern(p_i) $$

--
- We can then use the predictor variables to model that probability of success, $p_i$

--
- We can't just use a linear model for $p_i$ (since $p_i$ must be between 0 and 1) but we can transform the linear model to have the appropriate range

---

## Generalized linear models

- This is a very general way of addressing many problems in regression and the resulting models are called **generalized linear models (GLMs)**

--
- Logistic regression is just one example

---

## Three characteristics of GLMs

All GLMs have the following three characteristics:

1. A probability distribution describing a generative model for the outcome variable

--
2. A linear model:
$$\eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k$$

--
3. A link function that relates the linear model to the parameter of the outcome distribution

# Logistic regression

---

## Logistic regression

- Logistic regression is a GLM used to model a binary categorical outcome using numerical and categorical predictors

--
- To finish specifying the Logistic model we just need to define a reasonable link function that connects $\eta_i$ to $p_i$: logit function

--
- **Logit function:** For $0\le p \le 1$

$$logit(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)$$



---

## Logit function, visualised

```{r echo=FALSE}
d <- tibble(p = seq(0.001, 0.999, length.out = 1000)) %>%
  mutate(logit_p = log(p/(1-p)))

ggplot(d, aes(x = p, y = logit_p)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlim(0,1) + 
  ylab("logit(p)") +
  labs(title = "logit(p) vs. p")
```

---

## Properties of the logit

- The logit function takes a value between 0 and 1 and maps it to a value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$

--
- Inverse logit (logistic) function:
$$g^{-1}(x) = \frac{\exp(x)}{1+\exp(x)} = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$$

--
- The inverse logit function takes a value between $-\infty$ and $\infty$ and maps it to a value between 0 and 1

--
- This formulation is also useful for interpreting the model, since the logit can be interpreted as the log odds of a success -- more on this later

---

## Logistic function, visualised

```{r echo=FALSE}
d <- tibble(x = seq(-10, 10, length.out = 1000)) %>%
  mutate(logistic_x = 1/(1+exp(-x)))

ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = logistic_x)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylim(0,1) + 
  ylab("logistic(x)") +
  labs(title = "logistic(x) vs. x")
```
---

## The logistic regression model

- Based on the three GLM criteria we have
  - $y_i \sim \text{Bern}(p_i)$
  - $\eta_i = \beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_n x_{n,i}$
  - $\text{logit}(p_i) = \eta_i$

--
- From which we get

$$p_i = \frac{\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k,i})}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \cdots + \beta_k x_{k,i})}$$
---

## Modeling spam

In R we fit a GLM in the same way as a linear model except we

- specify the model with `logistic_reg()`
- use `"glm"` instead of `"lm"` as the engine 
- define `family = "binomial"` for the link function to be used in the model

--

```{r}
spam_fit <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(spam ~ num_char, data = email, family = "binomial")

tidy(spam_fit)
```

---

## Spam model

```{r}
tidy(spam_fit)
```

--

Model:
$$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = -1.80-0.0621\times \text{num_char}$$

---

## P(spam) for an email with 2000 characters 

$$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = -1.80-0.0621\times 2$$
--
$$\frac{p}{1-p} = \exp(-1.9242) = 0.15 \rightarrow p = 0.15 \times (1 - p)$$
--
$$p = 0.15 - 0.15p \rightarrow 1.15p = 0.15$$
--
$$p = 0.15 / 1.15 = 0.13$$

---

## False positive and negative

|                         | Email is spam                 | Email is not spam             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Email labelled spam     | True positive                 | False positive (Type 1 error) |
| Email labelled not spam | False negative (Type 2 error) | True negative                 |

--
- False negative rate = P(Labelled not spam | Email spam) = FN / (TP + FN) 

- False positive rate = P(Labelled spam | Email not spam) = FP / (FP + TN)

---

## Sensitivity and specificity

|                         | Email is spam                 | Email is not spam             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Email labelled spam     | True positive                 | False positive (Type 1 error) |

- Sensitivity = P(Labelled spam | Email spam) = TP / (TP + FN)
  - Sensitivity = 1 − False negative rate
  
- Specificity = P(Labelled not spam | Email not spam) = TN / (FP + TN) 
  - Specificity = 1 − False positive rate

.question[
If you were designing a spam filter, would you want sensitivity and specificity to be high or low? What are the trade-offs associated with each decision?

# Prediction and classification

---

## Goal: Building a spam filter

- Data: Set of emails and we know if each email is spam/not and other features 
- Use logistic regression to predict the probability that an incoming email is spam
- Use model selection to pick the model with the best predictive performance

--
- Building a model to predict the probability that an email is spam is only half of the battle! We also need a decision rule about which emails get flagged as spam (e.g. what probability should we use as out cutoff?)

--
- A simple approach: choose a single threshold probability and any email that exceeds that probability is flagged as spam

---

## A multiple regression approach

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
.small[
```{r ref.label = "spam-mlr", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
```
]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r spam-mlr, results = "hide"}
logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(spam ~ ., data = email, family = "binomial") %>%
  tidy() %>%
  print(n = 22)
```
]
]

---

## Prediction

- The mechanics of prediction is **easy**:
  - Plug in values of predictors to the model equation
  - Calculate the predicted value of the response variable, $\hat{y}$

--
- Getting it right is **hard**!
  - There is no guarantee the model estimates you have are correct
  - Or that your model will perform as well with new data as it did with your sample data

---

## Underfitting and overfitting

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", warning = FALSE}
lm_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(y4 ~ x2, data = association)

loess_fit <- loess(y4 ~ x2, data = association)

loess_overfit <- loess(y4 ~ x2, span = 0.05, data = association)

association %>%
  select(x2, y4) %>%
  mutate(
    Underfit = augment(lm_fit$fit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
    OK       = augment(loess_fit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
    Overfit  = augment(loess_overfit) %>% select(.fitted) %>% pull(),
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols      = Underfit:Overfit,
    names_to  = "fit",
    values_to = "y_hat"
  ) %>%
  mutate(fit = fct_relevel(fit, "Underfit", "OK", "Overfit")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x2)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = y4), color = "darkgray") +
  geom_line(aes(y = y_hat, group = fit, color = fit), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, color = NULL) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "plasma", end = 0.7)
```

---

## Spending our data

- Several steps to create a useful model: parameter estimation, model selection, performance assessment, etc.

- Doing all of this on the entire data we have available can lead to **overfitting**

- Allocate specific subsets of data for different tasks, as opposed to allocating the largest possible amount to the model parameter estimation only (which is what we've done so far)

# Splitting data

---

## Splitting data

- **Training set:**
  - Sandbox for model building 
  - Spend most of your time using the training set to develop the model
  - Majority of the data (usually 80%)
  
- **Testing set:**
  - Held in reserve to determine efficacy of one or two chosen models
  - Critical to look at it once, otherwise it becomes part of the modeling process
  - Remainder of the data (usually 20%)
  
---

## Performing the split

```{r}
# Fix random numbers by setting the seed 
# Enables analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used 
set.seed(1114)

# Put 80% of the data into the training set 
email_split <- initial_split(email, prop = 0.80)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data <- training(email_split)
test_data  <- testing(email_split)
```
