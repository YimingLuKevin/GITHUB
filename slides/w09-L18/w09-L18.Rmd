# Prediction

---


## Continued - Building a spam filter

- Data: Set of emails. We know if each email is spam/not and other features.

- Use logistic regression to predict the probability that an incoming email is spam.

- Use model selection to pick the model with the best predictive performance.

--

- Reminder: split the data into a training dataset and a test dataset.

- Use the training dataset to investigate and fit models.

- Choose 1 or 2 models and test how well they predict the test dataset. 

- Helps us avoid overfitting.

---

## Spam filter dataset

.pull-left-narrow[
- Data from 3921 emails and 21 variables on them
- Outcome: whether the email is spam or not
- Predictors: number of characters, whether the email had "Re:" in the subject, time at which email was sent, number of times the word "inherit" shows up in the email, etc.
]
.pull-right-wide[
.small[
```{r}
library(openintro)
glimpse(email)
```
]
]

---

## Performing the split

```{r}
# Fix random numbers by setting the seed 
# Enables analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used 
set.seed(1116)

# Put 80% of the data into the training set 
email_split <- initial_split(email, prop = 0.80)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data <- training(email_split)
test_data  <- testing(email_split)
```

---

## Fit a model to the training dataset

```{r}
email_fit <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(spam ~ ., data = train_data, family = "binomial")
```

---

## Categorical predictors

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.width=10}
factor_predictors <- train_data %>%
  select(where(is.factor), -spam) %>%
  names()

p_to_multiple <- ggplot(train_data, aes(x = to_multiple, fill = spam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#CA235F"))

p_from <- ggplot(train_data, aes(x = from, fill = spam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#CA235F"))

p_sent_email <- ggplot(train_data, aes(x = sent_email, fill = spam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#CA235F"))

p_winner <- ggplot(train_data, aes(x = winner, fill = spam)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#CA235F"))

p_format <- ggplot(train_data, aes(x = format, fill = spam)) +
  geom_bar() +

## `from` and `sent_email`

.pull-left[
- `from`: Whether the message was listed as from anyone (this is usually set by default for regular outgoing email)

```{r}
train_data %>%
  count(spam, from)
```
]
.pull-right[
- `sent_email`: Indicator for whether the sender had been sent an email in the last 30 days

```{r}
train_data %>%
  count(spam, sent_email)
```
]

---

## `from` and `sent_email`

.question[
If we predict "spam" using only "sent_email", what do you think is the prediction for an email with *sent_email = 1*?
]

---

## Numerical predictors

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE, highlight.output=c(7, 14)}
options(width = 100)
x <- train_data %>%
  group_by(spam) %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  skim_without_charts()%>%
  yank("numeric")

print(x, include_summary = FALSE, n=22, width=Inf)

```
]

---
## Numerical predictors

Closer look at `"image"`: number of images attached.

```{r}
 train_data %>%
     count(spam, image) %>%
 print(n=12)
```


---

## Fit a model to the training dataset

```{r}
email_fit <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(spam ~ . - from - sent_email - viagra - image, data = train_data, family = "binomial") #<<
```

.small[
```{r}
email_fit
```
]

---

## Predict outcome on the testing dataset

```{r}
predict(email_fit, test_data)
```


---

## Predict probabilities on the testing dataset

```{r}
email_pred <- predict(email_fit, test_data, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(test_data %>% select(spam, time))

email_pred
```

---

## A closer look at predictions

.pull-left-wide[
```{r highlight.output=c(5, 11, 13)}
email_pred %>%
  arrange(desc(.pred_1)) %>%
  print(n = 10)
```
]

---

## Evaluate the performance

**Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve**<sup>+</sup> which plots true positive rate vs. false positive rate (1 - specificity)

.pull-left[
```{r roc1, fig.show="hide"}
email_pred %>%
  roc_curve(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  ) %>%
  autoplot()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="roc", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
```
]

.footnote[
.small[
<sup>+</sup>Originally developed for operators of military radar receivers, hence the name.
]
]

---

## Evaluate the performance

.question[
In this plot, what is the ideal point = (1-specificity, sensitivity) that we would like our curve to go through?
]


---

## Evaluate the performance

Find the **area under the curve**:

.pull-left[
```{r}
email_pred %>%
  roc_auc(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="roc", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
```
]

# Feature engineering

---

## Feature engineering

- We prefer simple models when possible, but **parsimony** does not mean sacrificing accuracy (or predictive performance) in the interest of simplicity

--
- Variables that go into the model and how they are represented are just as critical to success of the model

--
- **Feature engineering** allows us to get creative with our predictors in an effort to make them more useful for our model (to increase its predictive performance) 

---

## Same training and testing sets as before

```{r}
# Fix random numbers by setting the seed 
# Enables analysis to be reproducible when random numbers are used 
set.seed(1116)

# Put 80% of the data into the training set 
email_split <- initial_split(email, prop = 0.80)

# Create data frames for the two sets:
train_data <- training(email_split)
test_data  <- testing(email_split)
```

---

## A simple approach: `mutate()`

```{r}
train_data %>%
  mutate(
    date = date(time),
    dow  = wday(time),
    month = month(time)
    ) %>%
  select(time, date, dow, month) %>%
  sample_n(size = 5) # shuffle to show a variety
```

---

## Modeling workflow, revisited

- Create a **recipe** for feature engineering steps to be applied to the training data

--
- Fit the model to the training data after these steps have been applied

--
- Using the model estimates from the training data, predict outcomes for the test data

--
- Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data

# Building recipes

---

## Initiate a recipe

```{r initiate-recipe, results="hide"}
email_rec <- recipe(
  spam ~ .,          # formula
  data = train_data  # data to use for cataloguing names and types of variables
  )

summary(email_rec)
```

.xsmall[
```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(email_rec) %>% print(n = 21)
```
]

---

## Remove certain variables

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_rm(from, sent_email, image, viagra)
```

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## Feature engineer date

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_date(time, features = c("dow", "month")) %>%
  step_rm(time)
```

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## Discretize numeric variables

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_cut(cc, attach, dollar, breaks = c(0, 1)) %>%
  step_cut(inherit, password, breaks = c(0, 1, 5, 10, 20))
```

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## Create dummy variables

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())
```

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## Remove zero variance variables

Variables that contain only a single value

```{r}
email_rec <- email_rec %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_rec
```
]

---

## All in one place

```{r}
email_rec <- recipe(spam ~ ., data = email) %>%
  step_rm(from, sent_email, image, viagra) %>%
  step_date(time, features = c("dow", "month")) %>%               
  step_rm(time) %>%
  step_cut(cc, attach, dollar, breaks = c(0, 1)) %>%
  step_cut(inherit, password, breaks = c(0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 100)) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

# Building workflows

---

## Define model

```{r}
email_mod <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm")

email_mod
```

---

## Define workflow

**Workflows** bring together models and recipes so that they can be easily applied to both the training and test data.

```{r}
email_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(email_mod) %>% 
  add_recipe(email_rec)
```

.small[
```{r echo=FALSE}
email_wflow
```
]

---

## Fit model to training data

```{r}
email_fit <- email_wflow %>% 
  fit(data = train_data)
```

---

.small[
```{r}
tidy(email_fit) %>% print(n = 30)
```
]

---

## Make predictions for test data

```{r warning=FALSE}
email_pred <- predict(email_fit, test_data, type = "prob") %>% 
  bind_cols(test_data) 

email_pred
```

---

## Evaluate the performance

.pull-left[
```{r roc, fig.show="hide"}
email_pred %>%
  roc_curve(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  ) %>%
  autoplot()
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="roc", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
```
]

---

## Evaluate the performance

.pull-left[
```{r}
email_pred %>%
  roc_auc(
    truth = spam,
    .pred_1,
    event_level = "second"
  )
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="roc", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

  kable(col.names = c("", "Email is not spam", "Email is spam"))
```

---

## Cutoff probability: 0.75

Suppose we decide to label an email as spam if the model predicts the probability of spam to be **more than 0.75**.

```{r confusion-75, echo=FALSE}
cutoff_prob <- 0.75

    spam      = if_else(spam == 1, "Email is spam", "Email is not spam"),
    spam_pred = if_else(.pred_1 > cutoff_prob, "Email labelled spam", "Email labelled not spam")
    ) %>%
  count(spam_pred, spam) %>%
